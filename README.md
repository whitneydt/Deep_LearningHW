# Deep_LearningHW
In this notebook I have deployed the use deep learning recurrent neural networks to model bitcoin closing prices. One model will uses the FNG indicators to predict the closing price while the second model will use a window of closing prices to predict the nth closing price.

I have prepared the data for training and testing buit and trained cutsom LTSM RNNS.

EVALUATION:
I found that the model using the closing prices tracks the values better over time as copmared to using the FNG.

I have found that 2 days as the window size gives the best outcomes for the model
